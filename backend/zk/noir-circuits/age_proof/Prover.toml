# Example inputs for Age Proof Circuit
# This file demonstrates how to provide inputs for proving you are at least 18 years old
# born on May 15, 1995

# Private inputs (never revealed on-chain)
birth_year = 1995
birth_month = 5
birth_day = 15

# Public inputs (visible on-chain)
min_age = 18
current_year = 2024
current_month = 11
current_day = 22

# Expected outputs (calculated by the circuit)
age_valid = true
age_commitment = "0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef"

# Instructions:
# 1. Replace the private inputs with your actual birth date
# 2. Update current_year, current_month, current_day to today's date
# 3. The circuit will calculate if you meet the min_age requirement
# 4. Run: nargo prove
# 5. The proof can be verified without revealing your exact age or birth date
